# Assessment Context

This module provides a centralized system for managing user assessment data throughout the application.

## Purpose

The assessment context allows components to:

- Store and retrieve user-provided health assessment information
- Calculate patterns based on user inputs
- Generate personalized recommendations
- Persist assessment data between sessions
- Transform data into different formats as needed

It separates UI components from the underlying business logic, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.
