# Assessment Route Tests

## Key Test Outcomes

| Test                             | Status  | Notes                                                          |
|----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| assessment-send-success.test.js  | PASS    | Creates assessment successfully with status 201                |
| assessment-delete-success.test.js| PASS    | Deletes assessment successfully with status 200                |
| assessment-detail-success.test.js| PASS*   | Returns assessment details with status 200, but with unhandled error about port already in use |
| assessment-list-success.test.js  | FAIL    | Import error: Failed to load url "../../../../../../db/index.js" |

## Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts** - Detail test has port conflict with other tests (EADDRINUSE on port 5000)
2. **Path Resolution** - List test has path resolution issue for db/index.js

## To-Do

1. Fix path imports in assessment-list-success.test.js
2. Ensure tests use unique ports to avoid conflicts
