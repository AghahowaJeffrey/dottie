```bash
cd backend; npx playwright test routes/__tests__/e2e/dev/master-integration/master-integration.api.pw.spec.js
```

This command navigates to the `backend` directory and runs the specific Playwright test file for the dev master integration (`master-integration.api.pw.spec.js`) using the default Playwright configuration (`playwright.config.js`).
