# How to contribute a pull request

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/issues) tab
2. submit an initial commit and convert to a `pull request`
3. convert your pull request to `draft` (illustration below)
4. reference the existing issue with the # feature e.g. `#134`.
5. **convert the PR to an open pull request when ready!**

# What to check before starting a pull request

1. [Issues Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/issues): check if someone commented on the issue already
2. [Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/pulls): check the existing drafts

It may be worth reaching out to that peer and offering to contribute an isolated issue to their branch

# What to include before completing a pull request

1. pull from `main` branch to ensure no merge conflicts between `branch` and `main`
2. run `cd frontend; npm run build` causing no typescript errors
3. issue # included in description
4. add **screenshots and or screen recordings** of the new outcome

Optional: to request the admin team to manually test the branch in their IDE, you can add the label `action required: manual testing`

template provided [here]($$$$$$$$$$)

# Code Owner guidance for reviewing PRs.

If steps 1-4 have been followed it is be sufficient to review the files changed without manual testing.

If steps 1-4 have not been followed then a relevant `action required` label can be added.

If contributor has included `action required: manual testing` then the PR will need to be manually reproduced and tested in the IDE. Understandably, this can take longer to approve than a standard Pull Request.
